def bidirectional_search(graph, start, target):
    '''
    Performs a bidirectional search on an undirected graph and returns the shortest path between two nodes.
    To do this, it simultaneously uses two breadth-first searches (BFS) from the start and target nodes.
    When the two searches meet, the path is reconstructed by backtracking to the start and target nodes.
        Args:
            graph (dict): A dictionary representing an undirected graph where keys are node identifiers and values
                      are lists of neighboring nodes.
            start: The starting node in the graph for the search. Represents a key in the `graph` dictionary.
            target: The target node in the graph for the search. Represents a key in the `graph` dictionary.

        Returns:
            list: A list representing the shortest path from `start` to `target`. If no path exists, returns `None`.
