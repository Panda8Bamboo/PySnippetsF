# List Manipulation Module

## Introduction

The **List Manipulation Module** is a collection of essential functions designed to facilitate efficient data handling and analysis of lists in Python. Each function is crafted to simplify common tasks related to list operations, making it easier for developers to manipulate and analyze list data.

## Functionality Overview

This module includes several key functions that perform various operations on lists. Below is a detailed description of each function, including its purpose, parameters, and return values.

### 1. Remove Duplicates

This function removes duplicate elements from a list while maintaining the original order of the elements.

```python
remove_duplicates(lst: List[Any]) -> List[Any]
```

```python
remove_duplicates([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]) # Returns: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### 2. Flatten Nested List

This function flattens a nested list structure into a single list.

```python
flatten_nested_list(nested_list: List[List[Any]]) -> List[Any]
```

```python
flatten_nested_list([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]]) # Returns: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### 3. List Intersection

This function returns a list of elements that are common to both input lists.

```python
list_intersection(lst1: List[Any], lst2: List[Any]) -> List[Any]
```

```python
list_intersection([1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4]) # Returns: [2, 3]
```

### 4. Random Shuffle

This function shuffles the elements of a list randomly.

```python
random_shuffle([1, 2, 3, 4]) # Returns: A shuffled version of the list
```

### 5. Sort by Frequency

This function sorts the elements of a list by their frequency in descending order.

```python
sort_by_frequency(lst: List[Any]) -> List[Any]
sort_by_frequency([4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 4]) # Returns: [4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6]
```

## Summary of Enhancements

```python
print("Without Duplicates:", ListManipulator.remove_duplicates(sample_list))
print("Flattened Nested List:", ListManipulator.flatten_nested_list([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]]))
print("List Intersection:", ListManipulator.list_intersection([1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4]))
print("Shuffled List:", ListManipulator.random_shuffle(sample_list.copy()))
print("Sorted by Frequency:", ListManipulator.sort_by_frequency(sample_list))
```
